    "text": "Code review is a common practice in industry settings that promotes shared knowledge, facilitates team communication, and improves code quality. However, the skill of code review is rarely taught in undergraduate statistics and data science courses. Given the importance of communication and reproducibility, it would be incredibly useful to teach students this skill early. As a part of my M.A. thesis, I developed a number of code review resources for students to develop their code review habits.

    "text": "Data visualization is a predominant way we take in information today. As such, it is seen as a form of communication in many fields. We know that poor visualizations can cause confusion, misunderstanding, and distrust; this implies that the consumer’s experience (and their takeaway) is important to consider. However, when data visualization is defined, the process rarely considers consumption or the consumer experience. My venture into the world of data visualization starts here.\nMy current plan is to tackle the following three projects:\n\nAnalyze the wide variety of guidelines and recommendations that are currently out there for the creators of data visualization. I’d like to map these guidelines to the cognitive processes involved in the consumption of data visualization.\nUnderstand how students in an introductory data visualization course consume and create data visualizations (i.e. What features do they pay attention to and deem important? Will students identify with being a creator or consumer more?).\nUltimately, these projects will hopefully lead to a broader framework for the cognitive component processes of data visualization consumption and one adaptable set of recommendations for data visualization creators.\n\n\nPresentations\nLisinker, R.
