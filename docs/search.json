I have experience teaching introductory courses and workshops in regression, simulation, hypothesis and significance testing, and data visualization. I have taught students to use a number of softwares, such as R, JMP, and TinkerPlots. My research interests revolve around how students learn statistics and data science, with particular focus on communication within classrooms and communication with data (e.g. code review, pair programming, data visualization).\nI am an avid Pinterest user, I love karaoke, and I stop to pet every dog I pass (after asking their owner, of course).\n\nEducation\nPh.D. Educational Psychology with a focus on Statistics Education\nSeptember 2023 - present\nPsychological Foundations in Education University of Minnesota, Twin Cities\nM.A. Educational Psychology with a focus on Statistics Education\nSeptember 2021 - October 2023\nQuantitative Methods in Education University of Minnesota, Twin Cities\nB.S.

    "text": "Code review is a common practice in industry settings that promotes shared knowledge, facilitates team communication, and improves code quality. However, the skill of code review is rarely taught in undergraduate statistics and data science courses. Given the importance of communication and reproducibility, it would be incredibly useful to teach students this skill early. As a part of my M.A. thesis, I developed a number of code review resources for students to develop their code review habits.
